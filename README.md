# Privacy policy

Your data is yours. I take that seriously.

This policy explains what data Mylo collects, why it’s collected, and what control you have over it — in plain language.

I do not sell your data. I never have, and I never will.

## Who’s Responsible for Your Data

I operate Mylo and am the data controller for any personal data processed through the service.

If you have questions about privacy or your data, you can contact me at [max@mylo.fit](mailto:max@mylo.fit)

## What I Collect

### Account Information

If you create a Mylo account, I collect:
- Your email address

I don’t ask for your name.

Your email is used only to:
- Create and secure your account
- Contact you about important account or service-related matters

**Legal basis:** processing is necessary to provide the service you request (performance of a contract).

### Product Data

If you have an account, I store the data you intentionally enter into Mylo — for example, workouts and training sessions.

This data exists only so the product works.

If you don’t create an account:
- No product data is stored on my servers

**Legal basis:** processing is necessary to provide the service.

If you delete your account, your data is deleted within 60 days.

### Website Usage

I don’t track website visitors.

That means:
- No analytics
- No A/B testing
- No advertising
- No tracking of pages visited, session duration, browser type, or referrers

### Cookies

Mylo does not use cookies for analytics or advertising.

The only cookies used are required for authentication and are provided by Firebase Authentication. These are used to keep you signed in securely.

**Legal basis:** legitimate interest in securing accounts and preventing abuse.

### Emails You Send Me

If you email me for support or with a question, I’ll keep that correspondence so I can reply and have context if you reach out again later.

**Legal basis:** legitimate interest in providing support.

## Third-Party Services
Mylo uses a small number of third-party services to function:
- [**Firebase Authentication**](https://firebase.google.com) — account login and security
- [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com) — hosting and server infrastructure</p>

These services process personal data only as needed to operate Mylo and are bound by data processing agreements.

## When I Access or Share Data

I don’t look at your data unless it’s necessary.

This may happen:
- To keep the service running
- To fix a technical issue (with your permission)
- To investigate abuse or misuse (as a last resort)
- If I’m legally required to do so

If legally permitted, I’ll notify you before sharing your data in response to a legal request.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access your data
- Correct or delete your data
- Export your data
- Object to or restrict processing

If you’re in the EU or UK, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

To exercise your rights, email [max@mylo.fit](mailto:max@mylo.fit)

## Automated Decision-Making

Mylo does not use automated decision-making or profiling that produces legal or similarly significant effects.

## Data Security

I take reasonable technical and organizational steps to protect your data.

Some data is stored unencrypted at rest because it needs to be available for the app to function. Access is limited and controlled.

## Where Data Is Stored

Mylo is operated from Europe.

Data may be processed or stored in the EU or the United States, depending on the infrastructure provider (for example, Firebase or Netlify).

Where required, international data transfers are protected using appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent protections.

## Changes

If this policy changes, I’ll update it here.


I also keep a public, versioned copy of this policy so you can see what’s changed over time: [https://github.com/MaxMonteil/mylo-privacy-policy](https://github.com/MaxMonteil/mylo-privacy-policy).
